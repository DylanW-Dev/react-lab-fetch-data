# Project Overview
In this lab, I learned how to fetch data in React using a custom hook (UseFetch) and a corresponding component (FetchData). By encapsulating data-fetching logic into reusable hooks, I improved code maintainability. I mastered Reactâ€™s useState and useEffect hooks for managing state and asynchronous operations efficiently. Additionally, I learned to dynamically render fetched data on the UI with JSX, enabling the creation of dynamic and interactive components.

## Learning Objectives
Fetch data from an external API using the fetch API method within a React application

Implement a custom React hook (UseFetch) to encapsulate the logic to fetch data

Render the data retrieved from the API onto the UI and display relevant information such as name, importance, benefits, and the best time to intake for each item
